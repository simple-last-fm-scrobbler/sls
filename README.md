Simple Last.fm Scrobbler
========================

**This project is unfortunately in a bit of a limbo. The app works, and is available on Google Play, but I don't have the time to maintain it on my own.**

**If anyone wants to take part in developing this app further, I'm looking for contributors. Please email me, or just fork and code away.**

**Pull requests are very welcome!**


Simple Last.fm Scrobbler (SLS) is a simple app that scrobbles music listened
to on an Android phone. Scrobbling means submitting listening information to
Last.fm (and optionally/additionally Libre.fm) when you play a track, and you
can then get music recommendations and view you listening history and statistics
at Last.fm.

Before the release of a new version of SLS, it will be available here to test for
one week.

More info about scrobbling can be found on [Last.fm's FAQ](http://www.last.fm/help/faq?category=Scrobbling#201).

If you need inspiration on stuff to do, you might want to have a look at the list of issues.

**(b)** It presents itself to SLS as the Android Music Player. This means that it won't show up under "Enabled apps" under its real name, but under Android Music Player.
