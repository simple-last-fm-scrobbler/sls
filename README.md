Simple Last.fm Scrobbler
========================

Simple Last.fm Scrobbler (SLS) is a simple app that scrobbles music listened
to on an Android phone. Scrobbling means submitting listening information to
Last.fm (and optionally/additionally Libre.fm) when you play a track, and you
can then get music recommendations and view you listening history and statistics
at Last.fm.

More info about scrobbling can be found on [Last.fm's FAQ](http://www.last.fm/help/faq?category=Scrobbling#201).

**If anyone wants to take part in developing this app further, I'm looking for contributors. Please email me.**

If you need inspiration on stuff to do, you might want to have a look at the list of issues.
