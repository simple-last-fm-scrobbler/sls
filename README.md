Simple Last.fm Scrobbler (SLS) is a simple app that scrobbles music listened to on an Android phone. Scrobbling means submitting listening information to Last.fm (and optionally/additionally Libre.fm and ListenBrainz) when you play a track, and you can then get music recommendations and view you listening history and statistics at Last.fm.

Before the release of a new version of SLS, it will be available here to test for one week in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/simple-last-fm-scrobbler/sls/releases).

 * More info about scrobbling can be found on [Last.fm's FAQ](http://www.last.fm/help/faq?category=Scrobbling#201).
 * More info about scrobbling from the community can be found on [getsatisfaction.com/lastfm](https://getsatisfaction.com/lastfm).
 * More info about scrobbling from [Libre.fm's Project Page](https://git.gnu.io/foocorp/librefm/wikis/home).
 * More info about listens from [ListenBrainz's FAQ](https://listenbrainz.org/faq).
